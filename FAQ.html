        <h2>Everything is free except for time. But how is it done ?</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Simple. Upon entry you receive a personal card where the hour is marked. In the space you have a buffet where you can serve tea and snacks as much as you want. You have free access to the working desks and all
          the other services. At the end you leave us your card and only pay for the time you've spent. If you stay for more than 4 hours, you stop paying for the whole time after that.
        </p>
        <h2>Is there a special working place ?</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Yes! You will find all you need for you to work efficiently: a quiet place, high-speed internet connection, desks, lights, electrical outlets, printer, scanner, books and journals.
          In addition, we organize events to help you with your endeavours (workshops and courses)
        </p>
        <h2>Is there actually no limit at the buffet?</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Yes. You can serve on you own or ask for us to help. For food we provide with snacks (bisquits and rolls). To drink we offer hot and cold tea and water. If you wish for more to eat, you can bring your own, or
          bring from outside (there is a market and a grocery store very near by)
        </p>
        <h2>Do I have to make reservations ?</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">No need. We are open for everyone. However, have to work on a special project and you need specific equipment you ca write us at: contact@creativecorner.ro
        </p>
        <h2>We are a large pack and we wish to make a reservation!</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Reservations are made for groups counting more than eight persons. The price suffers no changes. Just send your request at:contact@creativecorner.ro and don't forget to specify the space you would like to use,
          the time frame, whether there is any particular activity you would engage in and your groups' number
        </p>
        <h2>I've just learned of an event I would like to join, how do I proceed?</h2>
        <p class="s-12 m-12 l-8 center">Anyone can join the events in our calendar. You can contact the organizer anytime if you need additional information. If you would like to organize your own event, please let us know at:
